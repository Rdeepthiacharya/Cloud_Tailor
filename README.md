# Project Description

This website allows users to browse and purchase women's clothing items and customize products. Users can create an account, reset their password, add items to their cart, securely check out, and place orders for customized products.

Additionally, the application features an email notification system that sends customers a confirmation email upon order placement, including product names, prices, and other relevant details.

The backend efficiently manages user accounts, product inventory, and order processing. It leverages Java Servlets and JSP to handle user requests, interact with the MySQL database, and dynamically generate web content.

Overall, this web application delivers a seamless shopping experience for women looking to buy clothing and customize their purchases online.
